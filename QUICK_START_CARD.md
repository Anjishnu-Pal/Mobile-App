# SensorMonitor — Quick Start (Mobile)

Install
- Sideload APK: open the APK on your device and install, or run:

```bash
adb install -r path/to/app-debug.apk
```

Permissions
- Grant NFC and storage access when the app asks.

Enable NFC
- Settings → Connected devices → NFC → ON

Read a Sensor Tag
1. Open the app.
2. Tap `Start` (if present) to begin listening for tags.
3. Hold the NHS 3152 tag close to the phone's NFC antenna (back/top of phone).
4. Wait 1–3 seconds for the app to show Temperature, pH, and Glucose readings.

Export Data
- Use the Export/Save button on the Data or Settings screen to write a CSV.
- Pull the CSV to your computer:

```bash
adb pull /sdcard/Download/sensordata.csv ./
```

Quick Troubleshooting
- NFC not working: ensure NFC is enabled and the tag is near the antenna.
- No readings: try another tag or check tag power/configuration.
- Background reading stops: disable battery optimizations for the app.
